     <h3> Barium</h3>
     
     
        <p>Barium is a white liquid that shows up clearly on an x-ray. <br>Once it is inside the body, it coats the inside of the oesophagus, stomach or bowel and shows up the outline of the organs on the x-ray.

If there is a tumour, it shows up as an irregular outline extending out from the wall of the affected part of the body.<br>

Barium does not do you any harm and passes through your digestive system. </p>
